# Status Effects

List of status effects that can be applied to an enemy and/or an ally:

| **Name** | Effect on Character |
|---|---|
| Freeze | Reduces the character's steps by 1 turn. |
| Fire | Deals periodic damage to the character for 2 turns. Removed by freezing or in a "Water" cell. Fire can spread. |
| Shock | Applies a mark to the target. If the target receives 2 "shock" marks, the target gains the "stun" effect. |
| Stun | The character becomes unavailable for the duration of the turn. After the stun ends, the character recovers 2 energy units. |
| Acid | If a character takes damage under the "Acid" status effect, they lose half of their shields from the total maximum amount. Removed in a "Water" cell. |
| Smoke | The character cannot attack under this effect. Abilities can only be used on themselves. Can be permanent or for 2 turns. |
| Weight | The character cannot be moved by an attack or action. Can be removed under certain conditions. Can be permanent or for 1 turn. |
| Feather | The character is moved by an attack for an infinite number of cells until they hit an object. They stop at the edge of the location. Effect lasts for 1 turn. |
| White Leaf | Absolute resist. Removes all effects for 1 turn and prevents both positive and negative effects from activating. |
| Destabilization | For the character on whom this effect is applied, the chance to resist negative status effects is reduced to 0. |
| Catalyst | Enhances all effects applied to the character. |
| Fall | If a character lands on an empty cell, they fall down and die. If it's a player character, they respawn with half HP only on the next floor. |
